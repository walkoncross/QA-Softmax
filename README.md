# Quasi-Angular Softmax (QA-Softmax) Loss for metric learning

_QA-Softmax_ is a modified version of _A-Softmax_ in [Sphereface](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08063) (or its previous version: _Largin-margin Softmax_ in [Large-Margin Softmax Loss for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02295).
The diffences between the two are as follows:
